    [BOSMiner API documentation](https://docs.braiins.com/os/plus-en/Development/1_api.html)

    This class abstracts use of the BOSMiner API, as well as the
    methods for sending commands to it.  The `self.send_command()`
    function handles sending a command to the miner asynchronously, and
    as such is the base for many of the functions in this class, which
    rely on it to send the command for them.
